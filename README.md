<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p>
<h3>Ticket Creation</h3>
  
This is where users provide information about their issue, such as the type of problem, urgency, and contact details. There are various ways information about an issue can be conveyed, but the process of ticket creation remains consistent through the help desk portal. An end user can either input the details of their issue directly into the help desk portal or call to explain their issue, in which case the help desk team would create the ticket on their behalf.

<h3>Ticket Categorization</h3>

The help desk team assigns a category to classify the type of issue and a priority level based on factors such as urgency, impact on business operations, and the number of users affected, ensuring the ticket is addressed in a timely and efficient manner. A change in priority can also affect the SLA (Service Level Agreement), which may require a faster resolution or allow more time to address the issue.

</p>

<h3>Ticket Assignment</h3>

Once categorized, the ticket is routed to the appropriate team, as well as their current workload to ensure a balanced distribution of tasks. This process helps match the ticket with the most qualified personnel, enabling faster resolution times and ensuring that critical issues are prioritized and handled by experienced staff.

</p>

<h3>Investigation and Diagnosis</h3>

The assigned technician thoroughly reviews the ticket details to understand the reported issue, checks any initial information provided by the user, and reaches out to the user for additional clarification if needed. Once all information is gathered, the technician begins troubleshooting by analyzing the problem, reviewing software or hardware, or even replicating the issue to pinpoint the root cause. This process may also involve consulting with other team members to ensure no potential causes are overlooked.

</p>

<h3>Resolution Implementation</h3>

The technician applies a solution to resolve the issue, which may involve implementing a software patch, replacing faulty hardware, adjusting system configurations, or providing step-by-step guidance to the user. Once the solution is successfully implemented, the technician updates the ticket with resolution notes and if possible, any recommendations or preventive measures to avoid similar issues in the future.

</p>

<h3>Ticket Closure</h3>

After user confirmation, the ticket is closed. Documentation is crucial to a successful environment. Tickets need to be documented properly so they can be used as reference if a similar issue shows up in the future.

<h3>Follow-Up</h3>

Optional follow-ups are conducted to gather feedback or provide additional assistance if needed.
